# An example of a multi-user setup of Feeds Fun

You can up Feeds Fun in a single-user mode by following these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:Tiendil/feeds.fun.git
cd ./feeds.fun/docker/examples/multi-user
docker compose up -d
```

Go to `http://localhost/` to access the web interface.

Enter your email, you should receive an email with a link to log in. Click on the link and you will be redirected to the Feeds Fun web interface.

**The comments in the `docker-compose.yml` and other files contain many details.** Those details are not required to run test instances, but we recommend reading (and changing some of them) before running Feeds Fun as a permanent service.

Check notes in [single-user example](../single-user/README.md) for more details about running a permanent instance of Feeds Fun â€” we try to avoid duplicating docs, so we will not repeat notes here.

Below you can find some really important notes about running Feeds Fun as a permanent service.

## Use HTTPS for permanent instances

This example is configured to use HTTP only to simplify the setup.

You absolutely **MUST** use HTTPS for permanent instances of Feeds Fun, otherwise your data may be compromised, passwords leaked, and so on.

To turn HTTPS on you should (see comments in the corresponding files):

- Update Caddyfile to use HTTPS.
- Update ffun.env to use appropriate ports and domain names.

## Supertokens

Feeds Fun uses [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.io/) for authentication. It is a well-known open-source self-hosted authentication solution with a lot of features and relatively easy management.

This example contains a configured SuperTokens instance, but you may want to tune it up for your needs. The official site contains extensive documentation on how to do that.

You also should be able to switch to the official SuperTokens instance (without self-hosting it), but we did not test such setup.
