# An example of a single-user setup of Feeds Fun

You can up Feeds Fun in a single-user mode by following these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:Tiendil/feeds.fun.git
cd ./feeds.fun/docker/examples/multi-user
docker compose up -d
```

Go to `http://localhost/` to access the web interface.

Enter your email, you should receive an email with a link to log in. Click on the link and you will be redirected to the Feeds Fun web interface.

**The comments in the `docker-compose.yml` and other files contain many details.** Those details are not required to run test instances, but we recommend reading (and changing some of them) before running Feeds Fun as a permanent service.

Check notes in [single-user example](../single-user/README.md) for more details about running a permanent instance of Feeds Fun â€” we try to avoid duplicating docs.

Below you can find some really important notes about running Feeds Fun as a permanent service.
