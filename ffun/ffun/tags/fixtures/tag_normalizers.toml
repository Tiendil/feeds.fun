# This is an example of the configuration file for the tag normalizers.
#
# ATTENTION: Normalizer ids <= 10000 are reserved for the system.
#            if you want to add a custom normalizer, use ids > 10000.
#
# ATTENTION: Always describe the reason for adding or excluding normalizer parameters.
#            With time it will be hard to remember the reasoning behind the decisions.
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which the normalizers are defined is important!
#            It ensures that the normalizers are not conflicting with each other.
#
# Additonal (temporary) rules:
#
# - We are ok with breaking proper nouns (books, movies, games, products, etc.).
#   They are not an often candidates for rules, later we'll have separate tag procesors for them.
# - We are ok with breaking or loosing some terms (like "order-by") if that allows us to create
#   a lot of much simpler tags for other cases. Later we'll have separate tag procesors for those terms.
