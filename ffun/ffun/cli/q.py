 lot of my concerns about the length and complexity of 60 Years in Space
 could simply be addressed by looking at the 5th edition Dungeons &amp;
Dragons Players Handbook and seeing how many rules players would be
willing to put up with just for character generation. But there's two
clear differences: there is an incentive to learn about what your
character can do, which is cleverly partitioned by class so that - for
instance - a barbarian never has to read about mage spells; and that a
lot of the invented or borrowed Dungeons &amp; Dragons lexicon has
entered general language usage over the 49 years it has been played.</p>
<p>Science fiction has a similar challenge, except each science fiction
world invents its own terms and adopts its own definitions for more
general terms such as robot. In a fictional world, the author has
control over the pacing and scope of the new language, using this to
teach the reader at a pace they are comfortable with. By procedurally
generating the world I could do something similar: have a massive list
of all possible science fiction futures, but only have a limited number
come up with each possible play through. I could even let the players
win the game or have the world or the universe end - whereas most
science fiction TTRPGs consist of a string of subgenre sand boxes which
let players play in their favourite without spilling over into another.<br></p>
<p>This still doesn't solve the language problem. If I wrote the
supplements using invisible ink and used a magic marker pen to reveal it
 as you play, I might be able to avoid you worrying about the names of
every possible type of human-robot-animal-alien hybrid mix. But I have
to be consistent in defining what a theriomorph, for instance, is so
that when you see that word in the rules you know it means a human who
has changed themselves to have an animal-inspired form. It helps, of
course, if you are a classical scholar or speak Greek, but in the end I
ended up using a lot of words that fall outside normal vocabulary. And
as a result, much of the five books consists of the definitions of
things.<br></p>
<p>I also coined some new words while doing this - apologies in advance
if one of these is your band name or user handle. This is not an
exhaustive list, but the most interesting.<br></p>
<ul><li>amorcracy - rule by a group of people who sleep with each other</li><li>beginling - the first member of a species (from endling) </li><li>bisentient - intelligent being consisting of one body and two minds</li><li>fandemic - a behavioural modifying pathogen which makes infected both moderately addicted to a pleasurable activity
and driven to&nbsp; infect people around them to get them addicted to the
same activity</li><li>posterhuman - human who has completely replaced
their body with a robotic body, but retains a humanoid form for
aesthetic reasons</li><li>skototropolis - a city that hangs underneath an aerostat</li><li>simgularity - a singularity that has occurred in a simulated environment and is therefore not transferable to the real world</li><li><p>storgearchy - rule by people who have children</p></li><li><p>Theseuvian - either a robot who has replaced themselves with human parts or a human who has replaced themselves with robot parts</p></li></ul>
<ul><li>tunafication - increasing proportion of fast twitch muscle fibers in meat</li><li>xenonaut - someone who explores digital environments looking for naturally evolved life</li></ul></section><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
