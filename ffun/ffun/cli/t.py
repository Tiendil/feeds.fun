text = '''Any advice on how to get started on a 2D action roguelike
Hello,

I am looking for some advice on how to get started on creating a 2D action roguelike (binding of issac style). I do have some past experience with rpg maker but it is quite limited for what i want to make and use Sql a lot for work.

What relatively noob friendly engine/tutorials would you recomand ?

For context ideally I would like to create a permanent buff shop between runs, have a random layout talking from per created rooms and have a few manditory 1 of a kind per floor.

Thanks !'''
