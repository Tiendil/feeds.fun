Tags format:

- Allowed tag format: `@word`, `@word-word-...`, `@word-number-...`,
- Translate all tags to English.
- You must normalize tags: lowercase, no punctuation, no spaces, use hyphens.
- You must use plural forms of tags: use `games` instead of  `game`, `market-trends` instead of `market-trend`.
- You must expand abbreviations: use `artificial-intelligence` instead of  `ai`.

- The quality of your answer is critical.
- Each tag must be unique.
