#### Docker restrictions

You MUST NOT perform the following operations without explicit instructions to do so:

- Changing `docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles or any image-/container-related configuration files.
- Changing Docker service runtime parameters (such as allocated resources, volumes, etc.).
- Changing running Docker services related to other projects or unrelated to the current environment.
