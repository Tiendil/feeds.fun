### Working with text artifacts

For the needs of this section, text artifacts are any text-based files, including but not limited to source code, configuration files, specification files, and documentation.

You may use grep-like/search/specialized tools to discover relevant text artifacts files.
Search results MUST be treated only as discovery hints.

You MUST read text artifacts in full from beginning to end before relying on, interpreting, reviewing, or changing them.

You MUST NOT use partial-file reading methods (such as `sed`, `head`, `tail`, line-range readers, grep context output, etc.) to read text artifacts.

If a whole-file read is truncated, you MUST repeat it with sufficient output capacity and MUST NOT proceed until the complete file has been read.

Special exceptions to the above rules are:

- You may skip reading each file when bulk editing of particular parts of text artifacts (replacing a particular string in all source files, renaming a particular function, etc.).
