### Design

These principles are your primary guide for making design decisions.

- Start with the smallest design that satisfies the current explicit requirements and preserves existing behavior. Do not design for hypothetical future requirements.
- Every proposed abstraction, entity, persisted value, workflow, etc. must serve a current requirement and have a current consumer. If removing it does not break required behavior or an existing invariant, omit it.
- Prefer one source of truth. Derive information when it is unambiguous, and do not duplicate facts for convenience, symmetry, debugging, auditability, or possible future use unless explicitly required.
- Before presenting or implementing a design, perform a subtraction pass: try removing each newly introduced concept and keep it only when its absence causes a concrete problem.
- Consider corner cases only when they follow from current requirements, existing behavior, or observed data and materially affect the design. Defer speculative cases instead of building for them.
- When several approaches satisfy the requirements, recommend the less complicated one (with fewer concepts, states, exectution paths, etc.). Present additional flexibility only as an optional extension.
