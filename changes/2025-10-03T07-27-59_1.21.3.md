**Operations required AFTER UPDATE**:

1. Run migrations `ffun migrate`

Changes:

- ff-518 — Silenced expected LocalProtocolError in feeds loader, due to the server closing the connection without following the protocol.
- ff-515 — Fixed displaying text on checkboxes in the GUI (some of them displayed inverted text).
- Tag normalizer now does not try to normalize technical tag parts `-dot-`, `-plus-`, `-sharp-`.
- ff-463 — Extended CLI `ffun cleaner` functionality to remove tags that are not assigned to any entry.
