Things to think about:

- single-user & oidc & supertokens modes works via single docker-compose (in dev)
- try to keep html/css for keycloak theming in this repo
- Backup KeyCloak DB
- note: keycloack only allows configuring from files at first startup, later we should use the admin API to manage realms/users
- self-servicing pages
- unify apisix.yaml by moving common configs into templates
- cookies propertis
- auth/registration — both should work
- manually check behaviour of 401 on post
- remove technical headers in apixis before sending request to backend
- fix main page layout
- registration page, switching between login/registration
- fix single-user / multi-user examples
- Caddy should be configured to proxy /spa/login and, generally, all /spa urls?
- better urls for keycloak pages & resources
- do we need AuthMode on backend?
- do we need AuthMode on frontend?
- do we need application.settings.app_domain?
- do we need application.settings.api_port?
- do we need application.settings.app_port?
- remove supertokens from readmer
- grep for supertokens an clear them from everywhere
- ffun.auth.domain todos
- check cors protection
- csrfToken protection
- readme — add note that help wanted for OIDC support, in case of any trouble create an issue.
- chain of redirects with visible blinking when we try to access a protected page by direct url (not from the main page)
- document test scenarious for auth
- `apisix-client` name is visible in the url, we should rename it to `feeds-fun-spa` or something else
- configure & simplify registration form
- configure registration/login links for frontend?
- check mobile interfaces (main page, login, registration)
- click on login and then back in browser, globalState.loginState is damaged (wrong)
- keycloak, duplicated logout (from the second tab) leads to error id_token_hint
- behaviour on cookie expiration
