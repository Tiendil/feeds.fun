Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer with few effective treatments. In this context, Zika virus has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its ability to selectively infect and kill GBM cells. To elucidate these mechanisms and expand the landscape of oncolytic virotherapy, we pursued a transcriptomic meta-analysis comparing the molecular signatures of Zika infection in GBM and neuroblastoma (NBM). Over-representation analysis of dysregulated coding genes showed significant enrichment of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NF-{kappa}B, and p53 signaling pathways. A refined list of long non-coding RNAs consistently dysregulated in Zika-infected GBMs was also developed. Functional review of these candidates revealed their potential regulatory role in Zika-mediated oncolysis. We performed validation of the less-researched targets in adult and pediatric GBM cell lines and found significant differential regulation, as predicted. Altogether, our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of Zika on GBM. We highlight potential therapeutic targets that could be further interrogated to improve the efficacy of tumor cell death and the utility of Zika as an adjuvant virotherapy for GBM and other related cancers.
