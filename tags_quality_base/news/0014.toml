<p>Investigations in the intervening days suggest that Routh proceeded with intent to assassinate the former president. On Monday, prosecutors revealed details of their investigation that indicate "probable cause to support additional charges." Prosecutors also indicated  a note Routh had written about his plans to kill Trump will be used as additional evidence. On the day of the attack, Routh is believed to have arrived at the golf course at 1:59 a.m. local time (0559 UTC), then staked out for twelve hours for Trump to appear, according to CNN.
</p><p>Routh had previously been arrested and convicted in 2002 for possession of a machine gun. According to NBC News, there were no records of him being incarcerated as a result.
</p><p>Attorney General <span class="interwiki-link-foreign"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland" class="extiw" title="w:Merrick Garland">Merrick Garland</a></span> said of the act; â€œ[v]iolence targeting public officials endangers everything our country stands for, and the Department of Justice will use every available tool to hold Ryan Routh accountable."
