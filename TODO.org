* DONE Table with pointers to the last processed entries

* DONE Queue/table with entries to process next by each processor

* DONE Background workers to fill queue

** DONE Moving pointer + adding entries to a queue must be atomic

* DONE Switch processor to the queue

* Data migration from the l_entry_process_info

* Remove l_entry_process_info

* DONE Remove logic, that uses l_entry_process_info

* Command to move entries from ln_failed_entries to queue

* Check that function of getting entries by pointer uses indexes

* `l_entries` to we need an index for `published_at` field for GUI?
