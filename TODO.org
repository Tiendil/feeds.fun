* DONE Table with pointers to the last processed entries

* DONE Queue/table with entries to process next by each processor

* Background workers to fill queue

** Moving pointer + adding entries to a queue must be atomic

* Switch processor to the queue

* Data migration from the l_entry_process_info

* Remove l_entry_process_info

* Remove logic, that uses l_entry_process_info

* Command to move entries from ln_failed_entries to queue

* Check that function of getting entries by pointer uses indexes
